    title: "The Human Side of Eye Care",
    excerpt: "Beyond prescriptions and diagnoses lies the heart of optometry - the human connection that makes healing possible.",
    content: "In my years of practice, I've learned that the most impactful moments aren't always about perfect vision outcomes. They're about the elderly patient who tears up when they can read again, the child who discovers colors for the first time with proper correction, and the young professional whose migraine headaches vanish with the right prescription.\n\nEye care is deeply personal. Every patient brings not just their symptoms, but their stories, fears, and hopes. As optometrists, we have the privilege of being part of their journey to better vision and, often, better quality of life.",
